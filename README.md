#  **THIS PROJECT IS PARKED** 

## crawling-service

This is my diploma project, which is intended to be a service for crawling,
parsing and indexing content from internet, based on Apache Nutch.

To start the service, you just have to run the script `scripts/run.sh`.
It will start a Hadoop cluster & a Solr cluster, formed from Docker containers.
You have to run on a server with resources which will scale based on your 
usage.
